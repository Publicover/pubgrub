# Read about fixtures at https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FixtureSet.html

# clearly adding the ingredientable_ids myself isn't ideal, but I can't get the following to work:
# ingredientable _ id : < % = Entree.find(ActiveRecord::FixtureSet.identify('two')) % >
# looks like fixture load order is the problem.

one:
  quantity: 1.00
  grocery: one
  ingredientable_id: 980190962
  ingredientable_type: Entree

two:
  quantity: 3.5
  grocery: flour
  measurement: Cup
  ingredientable_id: 298486374
  ingredientable_type: Entree

three:
  quantity: 250
  grocery: green_beans
  measurement: grams
  ingredientable_id: 980190962
  ingredientable_type: Side
